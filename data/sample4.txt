SEOUL, Dec 26 (Reuters) - South Korea is expected to approve on Tuesday a 100.23 trillion won ($81.35
billion) budget for 2001, emphasising infrastructure spending to counter a slowing economy and job losses
sparked by painful economic reforms.
The budget represents an increase of 5.6 percent from this year, although is 805 billion won less than a
draft plan.

It was endorsed by a National Assembly budget sub-committee on Tuesday but still needs the approval of
an assembly plenary session.
The budget for the world's 13th largest economy is more than twice the size of the draft budget tabled by
Russia last week, and over three times the size of Thailand's 2000/2001 budget.
Despite weeks of wrangling and a special session of the National Assembly, the ruling party's plans to set
aside 500 billion won for economic cooperation with North Korea escaped intact.
Defence spending was also left unchanged at a planned 15.38 trillion won, up about 940 billion won from
this year.
More infrastructure spending to help the construction sector, which has still not recovered from 1998's
recession, as well as more support for farmers and the unemployed was agreed upon in a deal reached
between the two main political parties on Sunday.
"To create more jobs, it is necessary to boost the construction sector," said Yoon Byung-tae, a deputy
director of the Budget and Planning Ministry.
He said infrastructure investment was raised 910 billion won to about 15 trillion won, compared with the
draft budget.
The central Bank of Korea has forecast gross domestic product growth of 5.3 percent next year, down from
a projected 9.3 percent this year.
Spending to help farmers and fishermen was boosted by 730 billion won to about 10 trillion won and
spending on social welfare by 101 billion won to 8.2 trillion won, Yoon added.
LOWER DEBT SERVICING
Yoon said falling interest rates would allow the government to provision less for sovereign debt servicing.
"The budget for interest payments on state bonds, earlier proposed at 2.6 trillion won, would drop to 2.0
trillion won in line with falling interest rates," Yoon said.

He said the budget would also slash 946 billion won from the government's proposed 2.7 trillion won
reserve prepared for disasters.
The main opposition Grand National Party backed down from demands that the ruling Millennium
Democratic Party cut back on 500 billion won reserved for inter-Korean business relations.
The main opposition had previously demanded, among other things, that spending on economic
cooperation with North Korea be chopped to 100 billion won.
Overall, the Grand National Party managed to achieve 805 billion won in cuts after seeking to reduce the
draft budget by 6.5 trillion won.
Debate over spending had left the draft budget in limbo and a special National Assembly session had to be
opened last week to resume negotiations.
South Korea has targeted a balanced budget by 2003 and expects its fiscal deficit to decline to one
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year from an expected 3.4 percent this year, the budget
ministry said.
Per-capita tax payments are expected to rise to about 2.5 million won in 2001 from 2.32 million won this
year, it said.
Officials at the ministry said the planned budget assumed a dollar/won rate averaging 1,100 won per dollar
in 2001.
The won fell to a 25-month low of 1,253.0 per dollar in trade on Tuesday, hurt by a weakening yen and a
strike at two top banks that threatened to spread to other lenders.
"We will probably have to raise the budget for oil imports and expenses for our diplomats due to the won's
fall," said Yoon. "But falling oil prices may compensate for the fall in the value of the won."
South Korea relies entirely on oil imports.
The ministry earmarked 151.4 billion won for building up the country's oil reserves, up 24.7 percent from
this year. The budget will boost state oil stockpiles to 32 days from 29 days. ($1=1,232.10 won).
