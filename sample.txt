Many had waited hours to catch a glimpse of the film's stars. Fans waved banners proclaiming love for
Hobbits and urging a clutch of Oscars for Jackson.
Like its predecessor, "The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring," this film was also based on the
J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy. Both were filmed in New Zealand.
"From a New Zealand point of view, it is one long tourism promotion. It's fantastic," said Prime Minister
Helen Clark.
A giant statue of movie character Gollum was unveilled and fans applauded stars Elijah Wood, Dominic
Monaghan and Billy Boyd, who played three of the hobbits.
The first film of the trilogy, "The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring" was a worldwide smash,
grossing $860 million and winning four Oscars.
The government appointed a Minister for Lord of the Rings and tourism bodies have been selling the
country as the home of Middle Earth, the mythical land where the film is set.
The filming of the second book in the Tolkien trilogy, which has attracted at least 100 million readers over
the past half century, took 18 months to film throughout New Zealand with a cast of 2,400.
The third "Rings" movie will be released at Christmas next year. Asked about the final film, Jackson said
it was "really cool, very emotional, very climactic."
